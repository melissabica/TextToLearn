#Text to Learn

##What is this ?
Text to Learn is a training tool, made with Social Enterprises in mind, that uses SMS to distribute training materials and to test users on their learning. Our goal is to give social enterprises a way to train employees and customers digitally and remotely. We will create an online dashboard, using RapidSMS and a cloud storage service, for social enterprises to upload and send training materials, manage users, and create SMS-based quizzes to assess usersâ€™ progress.
