\chapter{System Requirements}


\section{Requirements}
From discussions with a social entrepreneur, founder and CEO of Anudip Dr. Radha Basu, and by reflecting on our own experiences working abroad with social enterprises, we have compiled the following requirements for this project. Functional requirements are quantitative and describe the actual functions our system needs to be able to perform, while nonfunctional requirements are qualitative and describe the way in which the functional requirements are implemented. \\[-0.7\baselineskip]
