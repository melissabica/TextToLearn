\chapter{Project Management}

\section{Project Schedule}
Our development timeline for completing various portions of the project is defined in the Gantt charts (see \textbf{Appendix A}). There is one chart per quarter, each displaying the actual weekly timeline for the work Lizzy and Melissa accomplished. Since they worked together on all aspects of the project, there is no distinction between their work on the charts.

\section{Risk Management}
In addition to creating a schedule of when to complete different tasks for our project, we also compiled a list of potential risks to our project in the fall, including their probability of occurring, severity, and total impact. This risk analysis includes mitigation strategies for each risk so that if a risk were to occur, we would be prepared for it. These are defined in the following risk analysis chart, Table 1:

At the completion of our project, we re-evaluated out risk analysis and made changes to reflect the actual risks, severities, and impacts. This updated risk chart is defined in \textbf{Appendix A}.
